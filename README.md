# Waggle Bites: A cheese treat for your pawsome buddy  

### About this site:  
This is a landing page for a product that I designed while doing [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Foundations Course. The color scheme is inspired from a graphics gig that I did a while ago for a startup.

### Current Problems:  
- The site is not responsive. Currently, it's only optimal for devies with big screens (laptops, pcs, ipads). Hopefully, I will be making it responsive for devices with smaller screens in the coming days.  
- While I have tried to use as many Semantic tags as I could remember, it's not the most optimized site.  
- The classes' names are really messy and doesn't represent the related portions as it could have.  
- There's a few snippets of way-around I have used (Eg: ```display: table; margin: auto;``` when I couldn't center align something center horizontally and didn't want to use flexbox).
